J.A.R.V.I.S. Installation Guide
==============================

This guide will walk you through installing and setting up the J.A.R.V.I.S. project from scratch on Windows.

---

## 1. Install Python 3.10
- Download Python 3.10 from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/).
- During installation, check the box **“Add Python to PATH”**.

---

## 2. Download the Project
- **Option 1: Git (Recommended)**
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/BolisettySujith/J.A.R.V.I.S.git
  ```
- **Option 2: ZIP**
  - Download the ZIP from GitHub and extract it.

---

## 3. Navigate to the Project Folder
```sh
cd J.A.R.V.I.S
```

---

## 4. Create a Virtual Environment (Python 3.10)
```sh
python -m venv venv
```

---

## 5. Activate the Virtual Environment
- **PowerShell:**
  ```sh
  .\venv\Scripts\Activate
  ```
- **Command Prompt:**
  ```sh
  venv\Scripts\activate.bat
  ```

## 6. Upgrade pip, setuptools, and wheel
```sh
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
```

---

## 7. Install All Requirements
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 8. Install PyAudio and portaudio.dll (if needed)
- If you get errors with PyAudio, do the following:
  1. Download the correct PyAudio wheel for Python 3.10 from [Gohlke’s archive (Wayback Machine)](https://web.archive.org/web/20240201000000/https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio).
  2. Download the file named like `PyAudio‑0.2.11‑cp310‑cp310‑win_amd64.whl`.
  3. Install it:
     ```sh
     pip install path\to\PyAudio‑0.2.11‑cp310‑cp310‑win_amd64.whl
     ```
  4. If you get a DLL error, download `portaudio.dll` from a trusted source (e.g., [this community mirror](https://github.com/intxcc/portaudio-win-binaries)) and place it in your `venv\Lib\site-packages` directory or alongside your Python executable.

---

## 9. Install ffmpeg (Optional, for audio/video features)
- Download ffmpeg from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).
- Extract and add the `bin` folder to your system PATH.
- Test by running `ffmpeg` in a new terminal.

---

## 9a. Install qrcode (if needed)
If you get an error like `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'qrcode'`, install the package (with Pillow for image support):

```sh
pip install qrcode[pil]
```

This is required for the QR code generation features in J.A.R.V.I.S.

---

## 10. Provide Required API Keys
Some features require API keys. You must obtain these and add them to the code:

### a. **News API**
- **Get your API key:** [https://newsapi.org/](https://newsapi.org/)
- **Where to put:**
  - In `JARVIS.py`, find the line:
    ```python
    MAIN_URL_= "https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?sources=techcrunch&apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY"
    ```
  - Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual key.

### b. **WolframAlpha API (for knowledge queries, if used)**
- **Get your API key:** [https://products.wolframalpha.com/api/](https://products.wolframalpha.com/api/)
- **Where to put:**
  - In the code, look for lines like:
    ```python
    app_id = "YOUR_APP_ID"
    ```
  - Replace with your actual App ID.

### c. **Other APIs**
- If you use any other APIs (e.g., for weather, WhatsApp, etc.), follow the README or code comments for where to insert those keys.

---

## 11. Run the Program
- For GUI version:
  ```sh
  python JarvisUi.py
  ```
- For terminal version:
  ```sh
  python JarvisWithoutGUI.py
  ```
- Or main script:
  ```sh
  python JARVIS.py
  ```
